About Us EPFO ranks among the globe's premier Social Security Organizations, distinguished by its vast clientele and the magnitude of financial transactions it manages. At present it maintains 29.88 crore accounts ( Annual Report 2022-23 ) pertaining to its members. The inception of the Employees' Provident Fund dates back to the enactment of the Employees' Provident Funds Ordinance on November 15, 1951, which was subsequently replaced by the Employees' Provident Funds Act of 1952. This legislative journey began with the introduction of the Employees' Provident Funds Bill in Parliament as Bill Number 15 of 1952, aimed at establishing provident funds for employees across factories and other establishments. Over time, this legislation evolved into the Employees' Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952 , applicable nationwide in India. The administration of this Act and its associated schemes falls under the purview of a tripartite body known as the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) , Employees' Provident Fund. The CBT comprises representatives from various sectors, including the government (both central and state), employers, and employees. The CBT administers three schemes – Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme 1952, Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) 1995 and Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI) Scheme 1976 for the workforce engaged in the organized sector in India. The Board is assisted by the Employees’ PF Organization (EPFO), consisting 147 offices across the country ( EPFO's Organisation Structure ).The EPFO is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India ( click here 14-07-2015 ).

    "raw_content": "Government of India\nMinistry of External Affairs\nCPV Division\n(Patiala House, Tilak Marg, New Delhi)\n********\nDecember 23, 2014\nPUBLIC ADVISORY\n***\nIndian citizens living in India and abroad are advised to\napply for urgent re-issuance of their passports in the following\ncases:-\n(i). HANDWRITTEN PASSPORTS\nThe International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has\nset a deadline of the 24th November, 2015 for globally\nphasing out of all non-Machine Readable Passports (MRPs).\nFrom the 25th November, 2015 onwards, foreign Governments\nmay deny Visa or entry to any person travelling on a non-\nMachine Readable Passport.\nThe Government of India has been issuing Machine\nReadable Passports since 2001. The Passports, however, issued\nbefore 2001 and particularly those issued during mid 1990s with\na validity of 20 years will fall in the category of non-MRPs. All\nhandwritten passports with pasted photographs are also\nconsidered non-MRPs.\nBy the end of November 2014, it is estimated that there are\napproximately 2.86 lakh handwritten passports in circulation.\nApproximately 6 crore Indian hold valid passports.\nIndian citizens residing in India and abroad and holding\nsuch passports with validity beyond the 24th November, 2015\nare advised to apply for re-issue of their passports well before\nthe deadline in order to avoid any inconvenience in obtaining\nvalid visa or international travel.\nContd...2/-\n\n-2-\n(ii) PASSPORTS VALID FOR LESS THAN SIX MONTHS\nMany international travellers may not realise that having an\nunexpired passport is sometimes not enough to obtain Visas or to\nenter certain foreign countries. Indian citizens travelling on\nPassports which may expire in less than six months should\nrenew their passports before any upcoming international travel.\nIt is especially important to check the passports needs of any\nminor who may be accompanying their parents as passports for\nminors have a shorter validity period (5 years) than passports for\nadults (10 years). The universal practice in vogue now is; “Once\nyour passport crosses the nine-year mark, it is time to get\nnew passport”.\n(iii) EXHAUSTION OF VISA PAGES\nSome countries do not accept passports which may have\nfewer than two pages remaining. Please check your passport to\nensure that you have enough visa pages. There is no\nprovision of additional booklets/pages and you will be\nrequired to apply reissuance of passport following standard\nprocedures. Frequent travellers may opt for Jumbo Passport\ncontaining 64 pages.\n2. All Passport Issuing Authorities have instituted a simple\nand fast-track procedure for renewal of passports. For more\ndetails related to passport services, website –\nwww.passportindia.gov.in - or the National Call Centre\n(1800-258-1800 - Toll Free) may be accessed. Indian citizens\nliving abroad should visit the website of respective Indian\nMission/Post.\n*******",

The Passports, however, issued \nbefore 2001 and particularly those issued during mid 1990s with \na validity of 20 years will fall in the category of non-MRPs. All \nhandwritten passports with pasted photographs are also \nconsidered non-MRPs.  \nBy the end of November 2014, it is estimated that there are \napproximately 2.86 lakh handwritten passports in circulation. \nApproximately 6 crore Indian hold valid passports.  \nIndian citizens residing in India and abroad and holding \nsuch passports with validity beyond the 24th November, 2015 \nare advised to apply for re-issue of their passports well before \nthe deadline in order to avoid any inconvenience in obtaining \nvalid visa or international travel.  \nContd...2/- \n\n-2- \n \n(ii) \nPASSPORTS VALID FOR LESS THAN SIX MONTHS \nMany international travellers may not realise that having an \nunexpired passport is sometimes not enough to obtain Visas or to \nenter certain foreign countries. Indian citizens travelling on \nPassports which may expire in less than six months should \nrenew their passports before any upcoming international travel. \nIt is especially important to check the passports needs of any \nminor who may be accompanying their parents as passports for \nminors have a shorter validity period (5 years) than passports for \nadults (10 years). The universal practice in vogue now is; “Once \nyour passport crosses the nine-year mark, it is time to get \nnew passport”.  \n(iii) EXHAUSTION OF VISA PAGES \nSome countries do not accept passports which may have \nfewer than two pages remaining. Please check your passport to \nensure that you have enough visa pages. There is no \nprovision of additional booklets/pages and you will be \nrequired to apply reissuance of passport following standard \nprocedures. Frequent travellers may opt for Jumbo Passport \ncontaining 64 pages.  \n2. \nAll Passport Issuing Authorities have instituted a simple \nand fast-track procedure for renewal of passports. For more \ndetails \nrelated \nto \npassport \nservices, \nwebsite \n– \nwww.passportindia.gov.in - or the National Call Centre      \n(1800-258-1800 - Toll Free) may be accessed. Indian citizens \nliving abroad should visit the website of respective Indian \nMission/Post.  \n \n******* \n \n \n \n\n",

HANDWRITTEN PASSPORTS\nThe International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has\nset a deadline of the 24th November, 2015 for globally\nphasing out of all non-Machine Readable Passports (MRPs).\nFrom the 25th November, 2015 onwards, foreign Governments\nmay deny Visa or entry to any person travelling on a non-\nMachine Readable Passport.\nThe Government of India has been issuing Machine\nReadable Passports since 2001. The Passports, however, issued\nbefore 2001 and particularly those issued during mid 1990s with\na validity of 20 years will fall in the category of non-MRPs. All\nhandwritten passports with pasted photographs are also\nconsidered non-MRPs.\nBy the end of November 2014, it is estimated that there are\napproximately 2.86 lakh handwritten passports in circulation.\nApproximately 6 crore Indian hold valid passports.\nIndian citizens residing in India and abroad and holding\nsuch passports with validity beyond the 24th November, 2015\nare advised to apply for re-issue of their passports well before\nthe deadline in order to avoid any inconvenience in obtaining\nvalid visa or international travel.\nContd...2/-\n\n-2-\n(ii) PASSPORTS VALID FOR LESS THAN SIX MONTHS\nMany international travellers may not realise that having an\nunexpired passport is sometimes not enough to obtain Visas or to\nenter certain foreign countries. Indian citizens travelling on\nPassports which may expire in less than six months should\nrenew their passports before any upcoming international travel.\nIt is especially important to check the passports needs of any\nminor who may be accompanying their parents as passports for\nminors have a shorter validity period (5 years) than passports for\nadults (10 years). The universal practice in vogue now is; “Once\nyour passport crosses the nine-year mark, it is time to get\nnew passport”.\n(iii) EXHAUSTION OF VISA PAGES\nSome countries do not accept passports which may have\nfewer than two pages remaining. Please check your passport to\nensure that you have enough visa pages. There is no\nprovision of additional booklets/pages and you will be\nrequired to apply reissuance of passport following standard\nprocedures. Frequent travellers may opt for Jumbo Passport\ncontaining 64 pages.\n2. All Passport Issuing Authorities have instituted a simple\nand fast-track procedure for renewal of passports. For more\ndetails related to passport services, website –\nwww.passportindia.gov.in - or the National Call Centre\n(1800-258-1800 - Toll Free) may be accessed. Indian citizens\nliving abroad should visit the website of respective Indian\nMission/Post.\n*******",

HANDWRITTEN PASSPORTS\nThe International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has\nset a deadline of the 24th November, 2015 for globally\nphasing out of all non-Machine Readable Passports (MRPs).\nFrom the 25th November, 2015 onwards, foreign Governments\nmay deny Visa or entry to any person travelling on a non-\nMachine Readable Passport.\nThe Government of India has been issuing Machine\nReadable Passports since 2001. The Passports, however, issued\nbefore 2001 and particularly those issued during mid 1990s with\na validity of 20 years will fall in the category of non-MRPs. All\nhandwritten passports with pasted photographs are also\nconsidered non-MRPs.\nBy the end of November 2014, it is estimated that there are\napproximately 2.86 lakh handwritten passports in circulation.\nApproximately 6 crore Indian hold valid passports.\nIndian citizens residing in India and abroad and holding\nsuch passports with validity beyond the 24th November, 2015\nare advised to apply for re-issue of their passports well before\nthe deadline in order to avoid any inconvenience in obtaining\nvalid visa or international travel.\nContd...2/-\n\n-2-\n(ii) PASSPORTS VALID FOR LESS THAN SIX MONTHS\nMany international travellers may not realise that having an\nunexpired passport is sometimes not enough to obtain Visas or to\nenter certain foreign countries. Indian citizens travelling on\nPassports which may expire in less than six months should\nrenew their passports before any upcoming international travel.\nIt is especially important to check the passports needs of any\nminor who may be accompanying their parents as passports for\nminors have a shorter validity period (5 years) than passports for\nadults (10 years). The universal practice in vogue now is; “Once\nyour passport crosses the nine-year mark, it is time to get\nnew passport”.\n(iii) EXHAUSTION OF VISA PAGES\nSome countries do not accept passports which may have\nfewer than two pages remaining. Please check your passport to\nensure that you have enough visa pages. There is no\nprovision of additional booklets/pages and you will be\nrequired to apply reissuance of passport following standard\nprocedures. Frequent travellers may opt for Jumbo Passport\ncontaining 64 pages.\n2. All Passport Issuing Authorities have instituted a simple\nand fast-track procedure for renewal of passports. For more\ndetails related to passport services, website –\nwww.passportindia.gov.in - or the National Call Centre\n(1800-258-1800 - Toll Free) may be accessed. Indian citizens\nliving abroad should visit the website of respective Indian\nMission/Post.\n*******",
